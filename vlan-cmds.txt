Steps to Mitigate VLAN Hopping Attacks
Use the following steps to mitigate VLAN hopping attacks:

Step 1: Disable DTP (auto trunking) negotiations on non-trunking
 ports by using the switchport mode access interface configuration command.
 
Step 2: Disable unused ports and put them in an unused VLAN.

Step 3: Manually enable the trunk link on a trunking port
 by using the switchport mode trunk command.

Step 4: Disable DTP (auto trunking) negotiations on
 trunking ports by using the switchport nonegotiate command.

Step 5: Set the native VLAN to a VLAN other than
 VLAN 1 by using the switchport trunk native vlan vlan_number command.
For example, assume the following:
FastEthernet ports 0/1 through fa0/16 are active access ports
FastEthernet ports 0/17 through 0/20 are not currently in use
FastEthernet ports 0/21 through 0/24 are trunk ports.
VLAN hopping can be mitigated by implementing the following configuration.

S1(config)# interface range fa0/1 - 16
S1(config-if-range)# switchport mode access
S1(config-if-range)# exit
S1(config)# 
S1(config)# interface range fa0/17 - 20
S1(config-if-range)# switchport mode access
S1(config-if-range)# switchport access vlan 1000
S1(config-if-range)# shutdown
S1(config-if-range)# exit
S1(config)# 
S1(config)# interface range fa0/21 - 24
S1(config-if-range)# switchport mode trunk
S1(config-if-range)# switchport nonegotiate
S1(config-if-range)# switchport trunk native vlan 999
S1(config-if-range)# end
S1#
FastEthernet ports 0/1 to 0/16 are access ports
 and therefore trunking is disabled by explicitly making them access ports.
FastEthernet ports 0/17 to 0/20 are unused ports and
 are disabled and assigned to an unused VLAN.
FastEthernet ports 0/21 to 0/24 are trunk links
 and are manually enabled as trunks with DTP disabled.
The native VLAN is also changed from the default VLAN 1 to an unused VLAN 999.



You are currently logged into S1. The ports status of the ports are as follows:
FastEthernet ports 0/1 through 0/4 are used for trunking with other switches.
FastEthernet ports 0/5 through 0/10 are unused.
FastEthernet ports 0/11 through 0/24 are active ports currently in use.
Use range fa0/1 - 4 to enter interface configuration mode for the trunks.

S1(config)#interface range fa0/1 - 4

Configure the interfaces as nonnegotiating trunks
 assigned to default VLAN 99.

S1(config-if-range)#switchport mode trunk
S1(config-if-range)#switchport nonegotiate
S1(config-if-range)#switchport trunk native vlan 99
S1(config-if-range)# exit

Use range fa0/5 - 10 to enter interface configuration
 mode for the unused ports.

S1(config)#interface range fa0/5 - 10
Configure the unused ports as access ports,
 assign them to VLAN 86, and shutdown the ports.
S1(config-if-range)#switchport mode access
S1(config-if-range)#switchport access vlan 86
% Access VLAN does not exist. Creating vlan 86
S1(config-if-range)#shutdown

S1(config-if-range)# exit


Use range fa0/11 - 24 to enter interface configuration
 mode for the active ports and then configure them to prevent trunking.

S1(config)#interface range fa0/11 - 24
S1(config-if-range)#switchport mode access
S1(config-if-range)# end
