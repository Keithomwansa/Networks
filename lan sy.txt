Use the interface name fa0/5 to enter interface configuration mode.
Enable the port for access mode.
Enable port security.
Set the maximum number of MAC address to 3.
Statically configure the MAC address aaaa.bbbb.1234.
Configure the port to dynamically learn additional MAC addresses and dynamically add them to the running configuration.
Return to privileged EXEC mode.

Access the command line for S1 and enable port
security on Fast Ethernet ports 0/1 and 0/2.
Open Configuration Window

interface range f0/1 â€“ 2
switchport port-security

Set the maximum so that only one device can
 access the Fast Ethernet ports 0/1 and 0/2.

switchport port-security maximum 1

Secure the ports so that the MAC address of a 
device is dynamically learned and added to the running
configuration.

switchport port-security mac-address sticky

Set the violation mode so that the Fast Ethernet ports
 0/1 and 0/2 are not disabled when a violation
occurs, but a notification of the security violation is generated and packets from the unknown source are
dropped.

switchport port-security violation restrict


e. Disable all the remaining unused ports. 
Use the range keyword to apply this configuration to all the ports
simultaneously.
